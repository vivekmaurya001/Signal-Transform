# Signal Visualization with Vite + React and Stdlib

This project is a signal visualization tool built with Vite, React, and Chart.js. It demonstrates how to generate various signal types (sine, cosine, square, tangent, constant) using [stdlib](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib) functions, compute their discrete Fourier transform (DFT) with complex arithmetic, and visualize both the time-domain signal and its frequency-domain amplitude spectrum using Chart.js.
